# HP-fanfiction-analysis
This project aims at analysing the data created in the Harry Potter section of fanfiction.net

The first Notebook aims at making a first analysis of the data of the Fanfiction Harry Potter, on the summary of the fanfictions before starting a deeper exploration of the content of the fanfiction themselves.

In particular, a first goal would be to identify specifities of the different stories between languages, in terms of length, characters, etc.

A second objective will be to identify the main factors which determines if a story is finished or not. A first approximation, the length would be a major factor (a short story will be more easily finished than a long novel-like adventure), but we may identify (or not) other relevant factors.
